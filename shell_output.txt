Based on market sentiment, the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline is not expected to have a direct impact on Shell's future earnings. Shell is a multinational oil and gas company with a diversified portfolio, and the cancellation of one specific pipeline is unlikely to significantly affect its overall financial performance. Additionally, Shell has been actively diversifying its energy portfolio and investing in renewable energy sources, which may help mitigate any potential negative effects from the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.
