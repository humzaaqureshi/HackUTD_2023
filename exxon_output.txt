Based on market sentiment, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is likely to negatively impact Exxon's future earnings. The increased geopolitical tensions and the potential for escalating conflict in the region have caused a decrease in investor confidence and led to a fall in global energy prices. As Exxon is a major player in the energy sector, these developments could affect its operations and profitability. Furthermore, the prospect of sanctions on Russia, which has been called for by Ukrainian and Western officials, may disrupt Exxon's business activities in the country. Overall, the uncertainty and instability created by the invasion have created a bearish outlook for Exxon's future earnings.
